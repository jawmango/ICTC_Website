The Student side serves as a public-facing portal where users can
pre-register for courses. Upon pre-registration, students receive a billing statement and can
manage their profiles. This profile includes a list of courses they have pre-registered for, courses
they have completed, and a record of paid courses. To access these features, students must create
an account, which can be done either through email and password or by using the convenient
"Sign in with Google" feature.
